- **Share ideas.**
- **Ask questions you‚Äôre wondering about.**
- **Engage with other community members.**
- **Welcome others and be open-minded. Our community is inclusive and free-thinking üí™.**
- **...and much more!**

  > ‚û°Ô∏è It's essential to note that while technical discussions and common issue debugging are encouraged, this platform **_is not meant for direct support._** For support-related queries, please create an issue in the respective app/project repository, or contact the app developer directly.

  üì¢ If there's an app missing from our lists (or an app listed that shouldn't be), a noteworthy FOSS app discovery, or a workaround for a common issue that deserves attention, let's discuss it!

<!--
  For the maintainers, here are some tips üí° for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.

  üì¢ **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  ‚û°Ô∏è You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled ‚Äúquestion‚Äù or ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù.
