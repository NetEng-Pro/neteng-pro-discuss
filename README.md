## üëã Welcome to NetEng-Pro Discussions!

  Our community here is dedicated to fostering discussions among like-minded users who are passionate about FOSS and open-source apps. Here, you can share and collaborate on topics such as reporting abandoned projects, addressing common issues encountered, and expressing community preferences in the app ecosystem.

We hope that you:
  * Share ideas.
  * Ask questions you‚Äôre wondering about.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome others and be open-minded. Our community is inclusive and free-thinking üí™.
  * ...and much more!

  >‚û°Ô∏è It's essential to note that while technical discussions and common issue debugging are encouraged, this platform ***is not meant for direct support.*** For support-related queries, please create an issue in the respective app/project repository, or contact the app developer directly.

  üì¢ If there's an app missing from our lists (or an app listed that shouldn't be), a noteworthy FOSS app discovery, or a workaround for a common issue that deserves attention, let's discuss it!

<!--
  For the maintainers, here are some tips üí° for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.
